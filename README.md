- Hi, I’m @niko-vu!
- I’m interested in the arts and design (visual development + full stack development).
- I’m currently learning about full stack development... HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects with others :) specifically fun and unconventional sites that focus on creative design...! Also interested in collaborating on art projects as well so HMU!
- Reach out to me at fearoffunsies@gmail.com
